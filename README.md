# GitHub Actions Best Practices and Optimization Guide

## Lesson 1: Best Practices for GitHub Actions

### Objectives
- Write maintainable GitHub Actions workflows.
- Organize and modularize workflow code for reusability.

### 1. Writing Maintainable Workflows

#### a. Use Clear and Descriptive Names
- Name your workflows, jobs, and steps clearly.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  name: Build and Test Node.js Application
````

#### b. Document Your Workflows

* Use inline comments to explain steps and decisions.

  ```yaml
  - name: Install Dependencies
    run: npm ci
    # ci = clean install, faster and safer for CI
  ```

### 2. Code Organization and Modular Workflows

#### a. Modularize Common Tasks

* Reuse logic by referencing actions or reusable workflows:

  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Install Dependencies
          run: npm install
  ```

#### b. Organize Workflow Files

* Place workflows in `.github/workflows/`.
* Separate different processes:

  * `build.yml` for build
  * `deploy.yml` for deployment

## Lesson 2: Performance Optimization

### Objectives

* Reduce workflow execution time.
* Speed up builds using caching.

### 1. Optimize Execution Time

#### a. Parallelize Jobs

* Use separate jobs for tasks that can run independently.
* Apply matrix strategy for multi-version testing:

  ```yaml
  strategy:
    matrix:
      node-version: [14, 16, 18]
  ```

### 2. Caching Dependencies

#### a. Use `actions/cache` for Faster Builds

* Caches dependencies (like npm modules) for reuse across workflow runs:

  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/cache@v2
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-node-
  ```

## Lesson 3: Security Considerations

### Objectives

* Secure workflows and sensitive data.

### 1. Implement Security Best Practices

#### a. Apply Least Privilege Principle

* Only assign necessary permissions to workflows.
* Regularly review access and token scopes.

#### b. Monitor Workflow Activity

* Review workflow logs for unexpected or unauthorized behavior.

### 2. Secure Secrets and Sensitive Information

#### a. Use Encrypted Secrets

* Store tokens and credentials using GitHub Secrets:

  ```yaml
  env:
    ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  ```

#### b. Never Hardcode Secrets

* Avoid placing passwords, tokens, or sensitive keys in the workflow YAML directly.
